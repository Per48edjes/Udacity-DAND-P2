What sort of statistical tests could I run that would make sense if I have the entirety of the population?

>> Is the average salary for World Series winners each year above the average for all teams?

>> Treat the existing data as a sample of "all of baseball data" for all of time.

Is finding the percentile a good way to show relative prowess in for a given stat?
(e.g., 1906 hitting)

>> Using z-score to measure standardized differences.

What are the most telling pairwise comparisons?

>> Use pairwise regressions.
