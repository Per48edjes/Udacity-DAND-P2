For field players, do they get paid more in subsequent year if really good post-season in year erstwhile?

What is most important to win a World Series? (e.g., good hitting, pitching, defense, having superstars/paying big money for players, etc.)


Add ops, to that list, it's a more complete one for offense. I personally think better than avg, obp or slugging alone
For pitching you need whip. More complete measure

In addition to these important stats. Try and measure if team chemistry plays a factor
How long have players been on the same team for
Then also youth. Avg age of the roster, do cuts on both hitting and pitching
The Cubs and the Royals the most recent winners were the youngest teams I think in recent memory
Their position players were really young, but pitchers may have been older


Yes. Please also check, home grown talent. So if a team develops a player from its minor league system and they win the World Series with those players

Haha. I think younger home grown teams win. But the position players are homegrown. Money is spent on pitching 

This again is my hypothesis why young home grown talent is so important because they are usually really cheap and you get the most value out of them
