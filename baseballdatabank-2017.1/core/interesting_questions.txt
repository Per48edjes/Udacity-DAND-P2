[?] What is most important to win a World Series? (e.g., good hitting, pitching, defense, having superstars/paying big money for players, etc.)


In addition to these important stats. Try and measure if team chemistry plays a factor
How long have players been on the same team for
Then also youth. Avg age of the roster, do cuts on both hitting and pitching
The Cubs and the Royals the most recent winners were the youngest teams I think in recent memory
Their position players were really young, but pitchers may have been older


Yes. Please also check, home grown talent. So if a team develops a player from its minor league system and they win the World Series with those players

I think younger home grown teams win -- the position players are homegrown, money is spent on pitching

Hypothesis: young home grown talent is so important because they are usually really cheap and you get the most value out of them

CHEMISTRY EXPLORATION:
- How would I measure/index "home grown"-ness?

HYPOTHESIS TEST:
-- You can merge different data files and ask something more complicated like: Is the average salary for World Series winners each year above the average for all teams?
